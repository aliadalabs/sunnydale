# Summary 

Last year, TEST JOURNAL published this paper [tqdm: A Fast, Extensible Progress Meter for Python and CLI](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01277).

While potential authorship issues were noted by reviewers at the time and an attempt was made by the submitting author to contact one of the other major contributors to the package, JOSS published the paper as a single-author paper.

Sometime later, the authorship (and JOSS handling) of this submission was [flagged as problematic](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01277) by a major contributor to the software and JOSS conducted an internal review, and [concluded](https://joss.theoj.org/about#ethics) that there had been an ethical violation and offered the tqdm community one month to resolve the authorship issue.

Unfortunately, even after significant efforts from all parties, the tqdm community have been unable to resolve this issue and come to an agreed set of authors for their paper. 

# Resolution

As a result, with regret, JOSS is today retracting this submission due to a violation of its ethical standards.
